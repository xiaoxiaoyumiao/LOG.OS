# 3.1 N-Grams

**DEF** Our task is calculating $$P(w|h)$$ , where $$w$$ is a word and $$h$$ is a text history. For example $$P(\mathrm{apple}|\mathrm{I\ have\ an})$$ . To formalize the problem, treat every word in a sequence as a random variable $$X_i$$ . The probability of $$X_i$$ taking on a value $$w_i$$ is written as $$P(X_i=w_i)$$ . $$w_1^n$$ represents a sequence of N words $$w_1\dots w_n$$ . $$P(w_1,\dots,w_n)$$ represents the joint probability $$P(X_1=w_1,\dots,X_n=w_n)$$ .

* So we have $$P(w_1^n) = \prod _{k=1}^nP(w_k|w_1^{k-1})$$ 
* 这一条件概率难以统计获得，因为自然语言的特质就是要不断产生新文本，相同的文字序列几乎不可能重复出现。

**LM** **bigram** model makes the following approximation \(**Markov** assumption\): $$P(w_n|w_1^{n-1}) \approx P(w_n|w_{n-1})$$

* As a generalization, in **n-gram:** $$P(w_n|w_1^{n-1}) \approx P(w_n|w_{n-N+1}^{n-1})$$

  and in **trigram** model N takes on the value of 3.

  * To estimate the probability, we use **maximum likelihood estimation / MLE**. We count its frequency and **normalize** it to a value between 0 and 1: $$P(w_n|w_{n-1}) = \frac{C(w_{n-1}w_n)}{\sum_w C(w_{n-1}w)}= \frac{C(w_{n-1}w_n)}{C(w)}$$ 
  * For the general case of MLE n-gram parameter estimation: $$P(w_n|w_{n-N+1}^{n-1}) = \frac{C(w_{n-N+1}^{n-1}w_n)}{C(w_{n-N+1}^{n-1})}$$ 

* How do we understand MLE?
* If a word occurs k times in a corpus of size n, then MLE p=k/n is the probability that makes it **most likely** that the word will occur k times in a corpus of size n. \(may be under assumption that all words in a corpus take on values independently?\)
