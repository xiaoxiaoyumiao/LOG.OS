# Session

```python
# List of extensions supported to convert run arguments into actual fetches and
# feeds.
#
# Each element in the list is a tuple of (Type, fetch_fn, feed_fn1, feed_fn2),
# where the function signatures are:
#   fetch_fn : Type -> (list of Tensors,
#                       lambda: list of fetched np.ndarray -> TypeVal)
#     fetch_function describes how to expand fetch into its component Tensors
#     and how to contract the fetched results back into a single return value.
#   feed_fn1 : Type, TypeVal -> list of (Tensor, value)
#     Each feed function describes how to unpack a single fed value and 
#     map it to feeds of one or more tensors and their corresponding values.
#   feed_fn2 : Type -> list of Tensors
#     A callable for specifying tensor values to feed 
#     when setting up a partial run
