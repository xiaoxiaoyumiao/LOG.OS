# Unity

A few important examples of **internal** assets are as shown below −

* **Scenes** − These act as “levels”.
* **Animations** − These contain data for a gameObject’s animations.
* **Materials** − These define how lighting affects the appearance of an object.
* **Scripts** − The code which will be written for the gameObjects.
* **Prefabs** − These act as “blueprints” for GameObjects so they can be generated at runtime.

A few other important assets are Placeholder, Sprites and Models. These are used when you need quick placeholders so they may be replaced with proper graphics and models later.
